** BRUTE FORCE

The brute force approach is simple. Loop through each element xxx and find if there is another value that equals to target−xtarget - xtarget−x.

Complexity Analysis

    Time complexity: O(n2). Two Loops Running To Match Summation of Element of Inner and Outter with Target . Therefore, the time complexity is O(n2).

    Space complexity: O(1). The space required does not depend on the size of the input array, so only constant space is used.
